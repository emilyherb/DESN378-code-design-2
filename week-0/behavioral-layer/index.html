  <p>when you know how to code, anything is possible. including but certainly not limited to: </p>
    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>websites and apps</li>
      <li>create simulations</li>
      <li>analyzing data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>it can be a challenging skill to learn, but with time you will find it very rewarding.</p>

    <p>keep up with me on <a href="https://github.com/emilyherb/DESN378-code-design-2">GitHub</a> to see what I'm up to.</p>
