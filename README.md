## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
​
## Week 0: The Setup
​
### What I Learned
The concepts that were taught this week were about data types and variables. These are common in every coding language, so it was great review. I did become more familiar with querySelector.
​
​
### What Was Hard
I found a few obstacles when trying to reach the stretch goals - specifically adding a transition between the images when they are toggled. They were displaying stacked. It ended up being a simple error but that can always be a little frustrating.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to jazz up my webpage and add some animations. From code + design 1 I learned the surface of animations and how to make them your own using keyframes, but I don't know off the top of my head what they are called. I used 'blink' and 'glitch'. I don't know how to use copiliot since I have never tried, but that is a goal of mine since I think it would simplify my workflow.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I definitely need more practice writing javascript since it doesn't come easily yet. I find myself looking up how to do things / refreshers when I forget exactly how to do something.

### Week 1: Systems That Respond
# Learning Log
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
This week we learned about using a toggle in javascript. The idea of using a toggle and conditionals is something I am familar with in other programming languages but not in JS. 
Our reading covered design systems and I learned that those consist of not only style tiles but also pattern and component libraries, mission statements, and documentation!
​
​
### What Was Hard
I wouldn't say that anything was hard for me this week. Travis provided straightforward templates for our projects, and I really like using both codedex and html academy.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help jazz up my captions for The Storyteller because I do not have a way with words. 
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I think I will have difficulty using the naming conventions because I have been pretty unorganized up until now. It will be a good thing for me though and save me lots of time in the future.

### Week 2: Remembering Choices
